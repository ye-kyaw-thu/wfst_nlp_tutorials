# wfst_nlp_tutorials
This repository contains materials from a 5-hour WFST tutorial I delivered to LU Lab interns on 13 July 2025. The focus is on leveraging the power of Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) for core NLP tasks including word segmentation, POS tagging, and machine translation. Whether youâ€™re new to WFSTs or looking for practical implementations, these tutorials provide a solid foundation for understanding their applications in NLP.
